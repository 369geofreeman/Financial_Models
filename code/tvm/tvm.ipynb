    "\n",
    "You work for a new startup that is trying to manufacture phones. You are tasked with building a model which will help determine how many machines to invest in and how much to spend on marketing. Each machine produces $n_{output}$ phones per year. Each phone sells for $P_{phone}$ and costs $c_{phone}$ in variable costs to produce. After  years, the machine can no longer produce output, but may be scrapped for $p_{scrap}$. The machine will not be replaced, so you may end up with zero total output before your model time period ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity investment is limited, so in each year you can spend $c_{machine}$ to either buy a machine or buy advertisements. In the first year you must buy a machine. Any other machine purchases must be made one after another (advertising can only begin after machine buying is done). Demand for your phones starts at $d_1$. Each time you advertise, demand increases by $g_d$%. The prevailing market interest rate is $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model is limited to 20 years and a maximum of 5 machines.\n",
    "- For simplicity, assume that  is paid in every year, even after all machines have shut down.\n",
    "- Ensure that you can change the inputs and the outputs change as expected.\n",
    "- For simplicity, assume that fractional phones can be sold, you do not need to round the quantity transacted."
